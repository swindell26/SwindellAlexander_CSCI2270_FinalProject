# SwindellAlexander_CSCI2270_FinalProject

This project is an expansion on the forst craigslist project for 2270. This program will be able to read in information from a txt file to create entries, as well as take direct user input. The data in the project will be stored in a hash table, using vecotrs for collision resolution.

The user will be able to search in inventory for what he/she wants, and will be able to determine their own search criteria. To do this, the program will re-organize the hash table based on the option selected by the user. For example, if the user wishes to organize results by price, item, or location. 
Finally, there will also be an option to view items for sale, or items wanted, ir both.
